# Exercise 1.15

## a

```scheme
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
...
```

The procedure `p` is applied 5 times.

## b

Procedure `p` uses constant space and constant number of operations. Let $T(a)$ be the number of applications of `p` in the process of `(sine a)`. Since the process is linearly recursive, both time and space complexity are proportional to $T(a)$.

The process will stop applying `p` after $|a|$ reaches $0.1$, when the number of applications $x$ is such that the following inequality holds.

$$|a| \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^t \le 0.1$$

Assuming $a \neq 0$.

$$t \le \log_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(\frac{0.1}{|a|}\right).$$

And so we conclude that

$$T(a) = \left\lceil\log_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(\frac{0.1}{|a|}\right)\right\rceil = \left\lceil \frac{1}{\log_{10} 3} \left(1+\log_{10} a\right) \right\rceil=\Theta(\log |a|).$$
