# Exercise 1.19

We have transformation $T$.

$$T(a,b)=(a+b,b)$$

We also know that

$$T^n(1,0) = (F_{n+1}, F_n).$$

$T^n$ means $T$ is applied $n$ times, e.g. $T^3(a,b)=T(T(T(a,b)))$. Note that $T^0(a,b)=(a,b).$

The exercise asks us to consider a family of transformations

$$T_{p,q}(a,b)=(bq+aq+ap, bp+aq).$$

Notice that $T_{0,1}=T$.

Now, we'll calculate $T^2_{p,q}$.

$$\begin{aligned}
T^2_{p,q}(a,b)&=T_{p,q}(T_{p,q}(a,b)) \\
&=T_{p,q}(bq+aq+ap,bp+aq)= \\
&=\begin{aligned}T_{p,q}
(&(bp+aq)q+(bq+aq+ap)q+(bq+aq+ap)p,\\&(bp+aq)p+(bq+aq+ap)q)
\end{aligned}=\\
&=\begin{aligned}T_{p,q}
(&a(2q^2+2pq+p^2)+b(q^2+2pq),\\&a(q^2+2pq)+b(p^2+q^2))
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

We see that $p'=p^2+q^2$, and $q'=q^2+2pq$. Thus

$$T^2_{p,q}=T_{p',q'}=T_{(p^2+q^2),(q^2+2pq)}.$$

We can now use this fact to calculate Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time by utilizing the property

$$T^n_{p,q}=(T^2_{p,q})^{n/2}=T_{p',q'}^{n/2}.$$
