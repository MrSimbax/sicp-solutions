# Exercise 1.41

Perhaps surprisingly, the result is $21$, not $13$.

To see why, we could follow the evaluation process carefully, but the expression is so complicated it's easy to lose the forest for the trees. As Gerald Jay Sussman [said](https://youtu.be/V_7mmwpgJHU?si=F9Zbp2F64G831-LV&t=597) in one of his lectures

> But one of the things we have to learn how to do is ignore details. The key to understanding complicated things is to know what not to look at, and what not to compute, and what not to think.

The important part is understanding the difference between

```scheme
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

and

```scheme
((double (double (double inc))) 5)
```

We can think of `double` as a factory of functions. Given `f`, `double` produces a function `(f (f x))` (I am skipping the `lambda (x)` part for clarity).

In the second case, we're doubling applications of `inc` for each application of `double`, so in total we get $2^3=8$ applications of `inc`, and the result is $13$.

However, the first case is a little different, as we can't apply `inc` immediately. Instead, we're first creating a factory; `(double double)` results in a function _factory_ which produces `(double (double f))` when given a function `f`. Then we `double` _that_ factory, which gives us effectively another factory `(double (double (double (double f))`. Only then we can apply this factory to `inc`, and so we finally get `(double (double (double (double inc))`, $2^4=16$ applications of `inc`. Applying this function to `5` results in `21`.
