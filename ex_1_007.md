# Exercise 1.7

Great numbers caused infinite loop because we demanded too much precision.

Low numbers resulted in wildly inaccurate results because we demanded too little precision.

To improve both:

1. Instead of comparing guess^2 to x, compare guess to previous guess, to get rid of the square operation to which would also square the error.
2. Use *relative* error instead of absolute error, to account for the size of `x`.

## Note

On the web I found a solution which has "infinite precision" which uses `(= guess previous-guess)` comparison. The author claim is that since the numbers are stored with limited precision, at some point `(improve guess x)` will stop changing the number as there's not enough bits to store the result.

However, even if this solution works for this problem, the reasoning above does not prove that, and this approach does not work in general. For instance, the next exercise falls apart with this method.

NEVER use `(= a b)` to compare two floating point numbers, always use some kind of $\epsilon$. Each operation done on floating point numbers can increase the error due to lack of precision. The error is especially bad for subtraction. Thus, there's no guarantee that `(improve guess x)` will start returning the same number in the general case.
