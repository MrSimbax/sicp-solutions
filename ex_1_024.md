(Not going further than 1e9 because of `random` limitations.)

The ratio between 1e3 and 1e6 should be about $\frac{\log 10^6}{\log 10^3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$. The actual ratio is about $1.6$.

However, for bigger $n$ the ratio aligns with the theoretical result $\frac{\log 10^9}{\log 10^6} = \frac{9}{6} = 1.5$.

For small $n$ the result is slower than expected because it was set to perform $100$ Fermat tests for each prime, and that's a lot of tests for numbers of order $1000$. Note that there are hidden constants in $\Theta(\cdot)$ notation, so it's very much possible that a slower asymptotically method outperforms a faster one for small $n$. As another example, a simple algorithm like insertion sort which is $\Theta(n^2)$ is usually faster for small arrays than the more complicated QuickSort which is $\Theta(n \log n)$, so much so that some QuickSort implementations used in practice actually use insertion sort as part of their process for small enough arrays. It's all about the constants.
