# Exercise 1.25

No, she's not correct. Her `expmod` only performs modulo after full exponentiation. Numbers in computer are stored with limited precision, and huge exponents get outside the limited range very quickly. Even if big numbers were supported, handling them requires more computational power and memory. The whole point of modulo arithmetic is to only deal with small numbers: it is efficient, fast, and precise. So, her procedure is not suitable for the prime tester at all.
