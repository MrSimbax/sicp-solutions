# Exercise 1.13

## First Claim

$$F_{n} = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$

Where $\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, $\psi = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$ are the solutions to the following equation.

$$x^2 = x + 1$$

We'll prove it by induction, as per hint. First, base cases.

$$F_0 = \frac{1-1}{\sqrt{5}} = 0$$
$$F_1 = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}-\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}{\sqrt{5}} = 1$$

Now, assume the claim is true up to some integer $n > 1$. Consider $F_{n+1}$. From the definition of Fibonacci numbers, we have

$$F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}.$$

From our inductive hypothesis the following are true.

$$F_n = \frac{\varphi^n - \psi^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$

$$F_{n-1} = \frac{\varphi^{n-1} - \psi^{n-1}}{\sqrt{5}}$$

Hence, after some algebraic manipulations we obtain

$$F_{n+1} = \frac{\varphi^{n+1}\left(\frac{\varphi + 1}{\varphi^2}\right) - \psi^{n+1} \left(\frac{\psi + 1}{\psi^2}\right)}{\sqrt{5}}.$$

Notice that $\frac{\varphi + 1}{\varphi^2} = \frac{\psi + 1}{\psi^2} = 1$ from the definitions of $\varphi$ and $\psi$, and so we have obtained our hypothesis. $\blacksquare$

## Second Claim

$$F_n = \text{round}\left(\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}}\right)$$

The statement is equivalent to

$$\left|\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}} - F_n\right| < \frac{1}
{2}.$$

Thus

$$\left|\psi^n\right| < \frac{\sqrt{5}}
{2},$$

and

$$\left|1-\sqrt{5}\right|^n < 2^{n-1}\sqrt{5}. \qquad (\diamond)$$

Notice that since $4 < 5 < 9$, then $2 < \sqrt{5} < 3$, and so

$$1<\sqrt{5}-1<2. \qquad (\star)$$

It follows from $(\star)$ that we can get rid of the absolute value in $(\diamond)$.

$$\left(\sqrt{5}-1\right)^n < 2^{n-1}\sqrt{5}.$$

It also follows from $(\star)$ that

$$\left(\sqrt{5}-1\right)^n < 2^n < 2^{n-1}\sqrt{5}.$$

Which is what we wanted to prove. $\blacksquare$
