It seems the program is faster by a little less than a factor of $2$.
This is most probably caused by the overhead of the predicate for each input. For very small input the accuracy is too small to have definite conclusion, but it is possible that the overhead of the predicate makes the process even slower than before.

Below are results for removing the `if` from `next` by simply starting from number `3`. This doesn't change the result in this test, as we're checking only odd numbers.

The experiment confirmed the hypothesis, as the $n$ gets larger the average time improvement approaches the factor of $2$.
