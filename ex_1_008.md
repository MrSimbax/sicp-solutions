# Exercise 1.8

Pretty much the same as square root, just different `improve`.

## Note

As said in the note to previous exercise, a solution which uses `(= guess previous-guess)` falls apart for some inputs, for example, $n = 100$. The improving process gets into infinite loop as it starts to jump between two very similar results which only differ in 1 bit. This is why you almost never want to compare two floating-point numbers directly.
